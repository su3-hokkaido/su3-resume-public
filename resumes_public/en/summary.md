# Professional Summary

After graduating from university, I joined a SIer company and worked as a system engineer, primarily engaged in the implementation and development of internal information package systems (personnel management, payroll management, financial accounting management, etc.) for prefectural and municipal governments. I acquired foundational management knowledge through establishing operation and maintenance centers, designing BPO services, and setting up offshore development centers.

Subsequently, I joined a Vietnamese local company as the first Japanese employee and worked as a system consultant from an outsourcing standpoint, engaging in project management and organizational operations. I broadened my career by dealing and negotiating with a wide range of companies, expanding my capabilities as an engineer by working with diverse technologies, and gaining extensive experience from sales to engineering, as well as building overseas engineering organizations.

Currently, I have transferred to a Japanese SaaS company and was stationed in Vietnam as an engineering manager for multiple products including invoicing and company incorporation. Additionally, I participated as a leader in the planning and launch of a new product, responsible for product roadmap planning, organizational development and operations, specification coordination with other teams, product improvement development planning, and various reviews.
